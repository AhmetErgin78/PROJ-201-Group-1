# General Information About Project
This project aims to explore various aspects of recipes and ingredients with socio-economic data like GDP per capita, IQ, and Life expectancy. Data was collected from mostly public and trustworthy datasets. To eliminate problematic and duplicate values data cleaning was applied. Then datasets were combined and 2018-2019 were selected as target years for consistency. The frequency of the ingredients in a region was calculated by summing all occurrences  of an ingredient and then dividing the number of recipes. It was asked from ChatGPT4 4  to give a number between 0 and 100 to each ingredient according to their health value and then the health value of recipes was calculated. Using Plotly and Dash data visualization tools implemented to improve user experience.
